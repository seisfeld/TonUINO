Alternative TonUINO Firmware
============================

This is my alternative firmware for the wonderful [TonUINO](https://www.voss.earth/tonuino/) project. The goal of this firmware is not to implement 100% the same features as the original firmware. I more or less just added what fits my use case and i also removed (for now?) some stuff i currently don't really need. Overall it's just fun to play around with TonUINO, which is also the reason why i am very active in the [TonUINO Community](https://discourse.voss.earth/). Make sure you drop by, there is lots of stuff to discover.

**The firmware is provided "as-is". I'm happy if all this is useful for anyone else, but can't offer support.**

## Button Cheat Sheet

## SD Card Folder Structure

The folders on the SD card, that will hold your media files, need to be named **01 bis 99** - that is **two digits**. The media files in these folders need to start with a **three digit zero padded number** like **001 to 255**, but may [1] contain more characters afterwards. Allowed would be `001.mp3` or `001MyTune.mp3`.

It has been proven benefitial to prepare the whole folder structure on the computer and then copy everything to the SD card in one go. That way it's made sure the order of the files is correct.

[1] Not all derivates of the DFPlayer Mini module accept characters after the three digit number. In this case only `001.mp3`, `002.mp3` etc. would be allowed.

## Audio Messages

TonUINO only functions correctly, when there is the correct (**as in matches the firmware**) set of audio messages on the SD card. These are stored in the folders **mp3** and **advert**.

On macOS it's pretty simple, to create the matching set of audio messages, using the `create_audio_messages.sh` script supplied in this repo. It just needs the tools `say` (part of macOS) and `ffmpeg`. The later can quickly be installed via Homebrew.

To install Homebrew follow the instructions on the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) website. After that, please follow these simple steps:

### Install ffmpeg

1. `brew update`
2. `brew install ffmpeg`

When that completed successfully, you can create the audio messages:

### Create Audio Messages

1. Change into the folder where you unzipped the `.zip` from GitHub or where you cloned the repo to.
2. run `sh create_audio_messages.sh`.
3. Copy the folders **mp3** und **advert** in one go to the SD Card.

The audio message files are not available for download at this point in time.
